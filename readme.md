Welcome to LemonKat's Cursed Code Emporium!

Who says code has to be useful to be meaningful? This is a hodge podge of silly and useless but nonetheless interesting code.

Most software is like an academic paper - formal, a little boring, gets a job done and communicates what it needs to. The software here is more like poetry - experimentation with the limits of language, with no real purpose beyond art. Actually, the stuff here is probably more like [Vogon poetry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysb-TwA7JCQ&pp=ygUMdm9nb24gcG9ldHJ5).

Thereâ€™s:
 * Entire algorithms on single lines
 * Absurd data structures with no advantages over existing implementations
 * Overly convoluted ways to determine if a number is greater than 4
 * And more!

Being able to do this sort of thing is why I really like CS - you have this near infinite sandbox where you can do anything you want. There's nothing stopping you from getting near-instant access to the cutting edge of machine learning, and equally nothing stopping you from doing anything else.
