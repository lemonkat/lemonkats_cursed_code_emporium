#### Welcome to LemonKat's Cursed Code Emporium!

Most software is like an academic paper - formal, a little boring, gets a job done and communicates what it needs to.  
The software here is more like poetry - experimentation with the limits of language, with no real purpose beyond art.

Actually, the stuff here is probably more like [Vogon poetry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysb-TwA7JCQ&pp=ygUMdm9nb24gcG9ldHJ5).

Being able to do this sort of thing is why I really like CS - you have this near infinite sandbox where you can do anything you want. There's nothing stopping you from getting near-instant access to the cutting edge of machine learning, and equally nothing stopping you from doing anything else.
